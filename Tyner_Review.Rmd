```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##My Suggestions

#General
```{r}
#Make all markdowns one document

#gtools installation didn't work, double check your command

#files aren't easy to read after processing when opened in R, can't tell if snps are actually increasing/decreasing. 
```

#Visualization
```{r}
#in second visualization, there is a typo in "Sample" for two of your x-axis. Also, I think your part 2 graphs should more clearly label heterozygosity and homozygosity (also, for mine I did a homozygous/heterozygous comparison and a missing data graph seperately, not sure what he's looking for for the final answer!)

#Nice third graph!
```
